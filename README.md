# Greenwashing Buster

Identification of greenwashing media content thanks to AI.


## Summary

The purpose of this project is to build an AI able to recognize elements of greenwashing in advertisment and PR content. 
It is analogical to spam filter or fake news identifier but it specializes in the field of sustainability and can be therefore more accurate and easier to build.


## Background

The problem of greenwashing is on the rise along with the attention given to the idea of sustainable development.
Some of it is intentional and some of it not but both types are doing harm to the idea and chances of averting climate crisis.
Me and my partners in earthnest.info project are helping businesses in line with SDG's to strive and this is one of our activities.


## Acknowledgments

This is based on the markdown template for the final project of the Building AI course, created by Reaktor Innovations and University of Helsinki.
